## Driver-Demand-Prediction-for-Optimal-Food-Delivery-Charges ##


Predicting the demand for delivery drivers in specific regions and
times, leveraging MLOps methodologies. By analyzing order requests, driver activity,
and related parameters, the goal is to optimize delivery charges, ensuring consistency
and minimizing customer drop-offs.  This project seeks to bridge this gap by forecasting driver
demand, thereby streamlining delivery pricing.
